Emulating Atari 5200 "Voice" output (Digital Sample output)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4-bit sample output is used by some games (eg: Bezerk).

This is done by setting a pokey channel (voice) to "pure" mode (ie: it's output is not tied to a counter, but set directly), and then writing sample values into the volume bits.

A new sample is written to the pokey every 2 scanlines, giving an output of:

PAL:  (301/2)*50 = ~7500 Hz	(???)
NTSC: (262/2)*60 = ~7860 Hz




To emulate:

Use an array of "sample event" structures:

typdef struct {
	short vcount;
	unsigned char value;
} SAMPLE_EVENT;

Every time a sample is written to pokey, add a sample event to the "sample event list" (array), using the current vcount, and the sample value being written to pokey.

At the end of the frame, render the sample events to an audio buffer.
Mix with the normal pokey output buffer.
